# Pi-Home-Temperature-Humidity-Monitoring
We recently renovated our home to add new HVAC systems.  The original part of our house was built in 1935, and we have an addition off the back.  I was interested in monitoring the temperature and humidity and also having a database and visualization of the same.  This lead me down the path of doing all this myself, even though there are commercial solutions.  Because, what fun would that be.  This project attempts to upload all the code and crontab tasks I have used to cobble this together.  Is it pretty no?  It does work, and maybe I can foster somebody else to do something with all this, or even make it better.  Warning: A lot of this is very kludgy, but in my defense, I am no longer a practicing software engineer, have not doing software engineering in a long time, and the syntax part of this was the biggest challenge for me.  I welcome any comments and suggestions for improvements, of course.
